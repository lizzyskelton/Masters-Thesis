## Overview
This folder contains the scripts written to analyse single-frequency EM data to obtain sea ice thickness measurements in Antarctica. Signal measurements are fit to the One-Dimensional Frequency-domain Electromagnetic Model (ODFEM) created by Irvin (2019). 

The data used spans landfast sea ice in McMurdo Sound across four freeze-in dates: August, May, March (2024) and multi-year ice. These areas are separated into two groupds, 'August' and 'Earlier' for analysis. 
- Data collected on Earlier ice was analysed under the assumption that the bulk conductivity of the sub-ice platelet layer was 800 mS/m. Measurements of consolidated ice (fast ice + snow) and sub-ice platelet layer were attained.
- One of the signal response measurements (inphase) was oversaturated on August ice. Therefore, apparent ice thickness measurements were attained on this section - a measurement of consolidated ice thickness + some proportion of the sub-ice platelet layer (30 - 40 %)
